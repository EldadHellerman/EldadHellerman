Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Eldad Hellerman.
I love programming, electronics, and everything in between. That's why I love embedded systems - I get to combine software with hardware.
I have years of experience with all sorts of different hardware, as well as many programming languages.
If you ask me what my favorite programming language is, I will have no answer; they are all so great!

Iâ€™m currently studying electrical engineering and computer science at The Hebrew University.

You can [visit my blog](https://eldadhellerman.infinityfreeapp.com/) to see some of my projects.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:EldadHellerman@gmail.com).
